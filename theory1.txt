💡 1. What is Emmet?

🔹 Emmet is a shortcut tool in code editors like VS Code.
🔹 It helps you write HTML/CSS faster using short abbreviations.

📝 Example:
div.container>ul>li*3 ➡️ becomes:

<div class="container">
  <ul>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
</div>

🏗️ 2. Library vs Framework

|                  | 📚 Library                 | 🧱 Framework                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 🔧 Who controls? | You control it             | It controls you                  |
| 🎯 Flexibility   | More flexible              | More strict structure            |
| 🧠 Example       | React                      | Angular                          |

👉 Remember:
Library = Your rules.
Framework = Its rules.

🌍 3. What is a CDN? Why use it?

🌐 CDN = Content Delivery Network
It loads files (scripts, images, etc.) from nearby servers.

✅ Why use it?
* ⚡ Faster website loading
* 🧠 Less work for your server
* 🔗 Easy to link tools like React

------------------------------------------------------------

⚛️ 4. Why is React called React?

🔁 React is named because it reacts to changes.
When data changes, it automatically updates the page.

➡️ No manual DOM changes needed.

------------------------------------------------------------

🔐 5. What is `crossorigin` in a `<script>` tag?

🌐 Tells browser how to load scripts from another site (cross-origin).

✅ In React development, it helps show full error messages from CDN scripts.

------------------------------------------------------------

🧩 6. React vs ReactDOM

| ⚛️ React                    | 🖥️ ReactDOM                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Builds components (logic)   | Renders them to the browser (HTML) |
| Used to create parts        | Used to show those parts           |

📝 Example:

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

------------------------------------------------------------

⚙️ 7. Development vs Production React via CDN

| 🔍 react.development.js     | 🚀 react.production.js            |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Used during learning        | Used when app is live             |
| Shows full error messages   | No extra messages (faster)        |
| Bigger file size            | Smaller & optimized               |

✅ Use:
* Development while building
* Production when deploying
